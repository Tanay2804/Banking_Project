ðŸ”µ AUTHORS: Tanay Tibrewal
ðŸŸ¢ VERSION or DATE: 1.5/ June 28, 2023
ðŸŸ¢ PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Provide/ Simulate the basic Operations done in a Bank Account 
                       Example: Withdraw, Deposit, Creation of new Account etc
                       with good support of exception handling and Elementry use 
                       of Data Structures. 
                       This project can be Expanded further by Connecting to a 
                       Relational databse like SQL & using APIs for Integration 
                       to a Website.

ðŸ”´ HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Define methods for each operation in the main 
ðŸ”´ USER INSTRUCTIONS:
    â—‰   Here our data is stored in a tabular manner eg: 
        [index]      name     accNo   accType     balamount
            1        Tanay    128     savings      1000000
            2       Tushaar   122     savings     1000000

        Hence getting the index of account number is a good way to fetch all our data. 
    â—‰   For each Operation implement the methods in the Bankwork class and define the operations.
    â—‰   It is advised to use a buffer reader object to input all the data as it eliminates any 
      downsides of the scanner class
